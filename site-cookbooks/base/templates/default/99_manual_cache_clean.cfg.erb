# In a private cloud with no user-data datasource it's a good idea to disable cloud-init's search for a datasource.
#
# manual_cache_clean is a cloud-config option that only works if it is in local config.
# manual_cache_clean is consulted before datasources are considered.
#
#  By default, the link from /var/lib/cloud/instance to
#  the specific instance in /var/lib/cloud/instances/ is removed on every
#  boot.  The cloud-init code then searches for a DataSource on every boot
#  if your DataSource will not be present on every boot, then you can set
#  this option to 'True', and maintain (remove) that link before the image
#  will be booted as a new instance.
# default is False
